Installation:
Currently tested and working on linux with python3. Dependencies need to be installed through pip. Dependencies needed are: 
 - chess
 - pygame 
Once these libraries are installed, run main.py with 'python3 main.py'

Overview:

To fully understand what's going on within the chess and pygame function calls, it's best to read the documentation on their respective websites.

There are three gamemodes, player vs player, player vs black CPU, player vs white CPU, and is chosen through the GAMEMODE variable ('P', 'W', and 'B' respectively)

All piece images are loaded into memory through loadImages() at the start for quick access. 

The board is drawn through pygame by first creating a black screen with the dimensions depending on the global variable 'size'. The game state is drawn at the beginning of a game, and after each move, with varying conditions determined by the gamemode. Drawing the gamestate is done as follows:
1. Draw the squares by iterating through both the rows and columns of the board (in this case 8 for each)in a nested loop, and each time draw an alternating colored rectangle, whose size is determined by SQUARE_SIZE, which is calculated by dividing the window size by the board dimensions.
